By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\nCopyright (C)\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program. If not, see .\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nCopyright (C)\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License. But first, please read\n.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/23/23520.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/23/23520.png?src=api&modified=1331218902"}],"homepageURL":"http://labs.securitycompass.com/index.php/exploit-me/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/xss-me/?src=api","supportURL":"http://labs.securitycompass.com/index.php/exploit-me/","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":16,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/xss-me/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":357493,"weeklyDownloads":521,"dailyUsers":5868,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/148902/xss_me-0.4.6-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":112930,"updateDate":1337252021000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"inspector@mozilla.org","icons":{"32":null,"64":null},"type":"extension","name":"DOM Inspector","version":"2.0.16.1-signed","creator":{"name":"SeaMonkey Council","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/seamonkey-council/?src=api"},"description":"DOM Inspector is a tool that can be used to inspect and edit the live DOM of any web document or XUL application.

How many times did you find that having the chance to debug the HTML, DOM and also the javascript of your page was *great*, but at the same time you wanted to have a faster access to dojo specifics? Exactly...That was one of the motivations behind this Dojo Firebug Extension.\nThe idea of this extension is to provide easy access to some dojo concepts. Coding and debugging time can be reduced by having features to monitor dijits, access higher-level dojo concepts and specific dojo properties (instead of just DOM properties), see the available connections and subscriptions and be able to set breakpoints on those.\n\nWith this extension you can:\n\n    View all the widgets registered in the dijit registry (as a Tree or as a plain list).\n        View their properties. For each widget you can also switch the view between \"dojo specific properties\" and \"classic DOM properties\". For example, whether the widget's startup() method was already invoked or not.\n        Highlight dojo widgets in the web page (when you mouse-over them).\n        View detached widgets (widgets not yet attached to page).\n    View information about the dojo version, dojo-config object, url modules of the loaded page, and the total number of widgets, connections and subscriptions (these numbers are automatically refreshed in the extension UI...useful to detect leaks).\n    View all available connections and subscriptions (global to the app), and also connections and subscriptions associated to a \"selected\" object. You can filter the connections table to find some specific ones to debug.\n    Set breakpoints to connections: in the connections's event, in the target method, and in the line where the connection was created (i.e. dojo.connect).\n    Set breakpoints to subscriptions: in the target method and where the subscription was created.\n    Open documentation associated to a dojo object.\n\n\nThe extension is integrated with the Firebug inspector. You can right-click on a dijit element in the web page and it will be selected/inspected in the extension panels.

decrement numbers and strings in URLs for navigating through URL sequences.","fullDescription":"URL Flipper allows you to easily increment or decrement a portion of a URL without having to manually edit the text in the Location Bar.\n\nOnce you have told URL Flipper which part of the URL you would like to change, you can flip through URL sequences with a single click of a toolbar button or press of a keyboard shortcut. It is very useful for navigating through image galleries, forum threads, etc.\n\n\n===== ===== ===== =====\nFeatures\n===== ===== ===== =====\n\n\n* Easy-to-use\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nURL Flipper can be invoked with customizable keyboard shortcuts or with the click of a toolbar button. The usage guide details all of the ways to use URL Flipper and the shortcuts that users can use.\n\nAnd to reduce the number of times you have to see the pattern setup dialog, URL Flipper can also remember your URL patterns across browser sessions.\n\n* Smart handling of bad URLs\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nURL Flipper has an option to seamlessly skip past bad URLs (those returning HTTP status codes 301-303, 403, 404, and 410), making it easier to get to the content that you are looking for. Additionally, URL Flipper will prevent redirects (i.e., HTTP 3xx and Refresh redirects) for pages that are loaded through URL Flipper (all other page loads are unaffected), so that your flow is not disrupted on sites that use redirects for errors.\n\n* Pattern options\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nURL Flipper supports incrementing and decrementingâwith customizable interval sizesâdecimal, hexadecimal, octal, and generic alphanumeric segments.\n\n\n===== ===== ===== =====\nSecurity of Data and Privacy\n===== ===== ===== =====\n\n\nIn order to remember patterns across browser restarts, it is necessary for URL Flipper to save information about the URL patterns that it has encountered. This information is saved locally in your user profile in a file named urlflipper.json. URL Flipper takes the matter of data privacy very seriously, and as a result, NO PART OF ANY URL IS EVER SAVED by URL Flipper. Instead, URL Flipper saves a cryptographic hash of a URL's pattern data, which means that it is impossible for anyone or anything to extract any URL patterns from this stored information without resorting to a brute-force trial-and-error attack. This design decision provides an inherent and significant layer of privacy for the URL patterns that are accumulated. For normal, everyday use, this means that the only way to peek at the stored pattern information is to visit a webpage and see if that particular page's URL is recognized as matching an existing pattern.\n\n\n===== ===== ===== =====\nMore Information\n===== ===== ===== =====\n\n\nMore information is available at the official webpage:\nhttp://code.kliu.org/urlflipper/\n\nUsage guide:\nhttp://code.kliu.org/urlflipper/usage.html","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/55/55434.png?src=api&modified=1300838093","width":"172","height":"86","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/55/55434.png?src=api&modified=1300838093","thumbnailWidth":"172","thumbnailHeight":"86","caption":"URL Flipper's toolbar buttons in Firefox 4."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/21/21672.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"200","height":"47","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/21/21672.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"47","caption":"If you prefer the mouse over the keyboard, you can add these toolbar buttons."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/21/21673.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"547","height":"299","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/21/21673.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"109","caption":"You will see the \"URL Pattern Setup\" dialog the first time you try to decrement or increment a URL."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/21/21674.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"391","height":"334","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/21/21674.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"175","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"You can customize URL Flipper's keyboard shortcuts."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/33/33509.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"360","height":"180","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/33/33509.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"100","caption":"URL Flipper is compatible with SeaMonkey, too!"}],"homepageURL":"http://code.kliu.org/urlflipper/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/url-flipper/?src=api","supportURL":"http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=669335","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":34,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/url-flipper/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":141133,"weeklyDownloads":128,"dailyUsers":3314,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/115505/url_flipper-3.1.1.20-sm+fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":39784,"updateDate":1301583382000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"minoru-kun@inbox.ru","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/358/358057-32.png?modified=1353752464","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/358/358057-64.png?modified=1353752464"},"type":"extension","name":"Vimium","version":"1.36.1-signed.1-signed","creator":{"name":"Minoru","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/minoru128/?src=api"},"description":"The Hacker's Browser.

And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\nCopyright (C)\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program. If not, see .\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nCopyright (C)\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.

Useful for both Penetration Testing and Search Engine Optimization. GSI sends zero packets to the host making it anonymous.","fullDescription":"Google Site Indexer, GSI, uses some of Google's Advanced Operators (Site and Inurl). By sending a site query such as, site:tankedgenius.com, to Google, one can retrieve all files Google has indexed. However, Google only retrieves a maximum of a thousand results. In order to get more results, one can combine the advanced operators, such as site:tankedgenius.com inurl:cp. GSI does both of these in order to generate a site index.\n\nInstructions:\n\nTo run Google Site Indexer, open Firefox.\nGo to Tools->GSI\nFill in the appropriate website.\n\nAlternatively you can right-click and Choose GSI. If you right-clicked on a link, the link will automatically populate the website field. Otherwise the current website will populate it.\n\nRecursive Search:\nIf you choose to use a recursive search, GSI will use inurl searches. For example, if you choose to do a Google Site Index on tankedgenius.com. It would first send a query site:tankedgenius.com. The query would return a result of http://www.tankedgenius.com/blog/cp/index.html. If a recursive search is at level is at 1, then it would also send a query of site:tankedgenius.com inurl:blog. It would then add the results from that to the index. If the recursion level is set to 2, it would also send a query of site:tankedgenius.com inurl:cp and get the results.\n\nFull website names:\nBy default GSI displays an indented site index with only the directory name showing for each link. If you would prefer, you can set this option so that it shows the entire link.\n\n\nNote: Due to the nature of the Google queries that GSI sends, GSI may get 403 errors from Google. These errors are normal when sending queries with multiple operators.","developerComments":"This version was developed on Firefox 3.5 on Linux, but should work on any OS with all 3.x versions.","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/16/16189.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/16/16189.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","caption":"GSI main window"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/16/16196.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"700","height":"421","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/16/16196.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"120","caption":"GSI sample run"}],"homepageURL":"http://dc949.org/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/google-site-indexer/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":4,"reviewCount":7,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/google-site-indexer/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":69224,"weeklyDownloads":1,"dailyUsers":5,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/22444/google_site_indexer-0.13-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":10240,"updateDate":1272889412000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"requestpolicy@requestpolicy.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/9/9727-32.png?modified=1410260538","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/9/9727-64.png?modified=1410260538"},"type":"extension","name":"RequestPolicy","version":"0.5.28.1-signed.1-signed","creator":{"name":"Justin Samuel","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/justin-samuel/?src=api"},"description":"Be in control of which cross-site requests are allowed. Improve the privacy of your browsing by not letting other sites know your browsing habits. Secure yourself from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and other attacks.","fullDescription":"RequestPolicy's new version is under development as RequestPolicy Continued. Ultimately, I'd like RequestPolicy Continued to replace RequestPolicy.\n\nRequestPolicy development has been slow because I am working on ServerPilot, a cPanel alternative for DigitalOcean servers. Thankfully, some great community members are taking over development of RequestPolicy.\n\n----\n\nRequestPolicy is an extension that improves the privacy and security of your browsing by giving you control over when cross-site requests are allowed by webpages you visit.\n\nCross-site requests are requests that your browser is told to make by a website you are visiting to a completely different website. Though usually legitimate requests, they often result in advertising companies and other websites knowing your browsing habits, including specific pages you view throughout the day. Among the attacks that cross-site requests are used in, they are particularly dangerous with Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks where your browser is told to make a request to another website and that other website thinks you (the person) meant to make the request.\n\nWith RequestPolicy, the default for any cross-site request is to deny it. Users are notified when requests on the current page have been blocked (the status bar flag icon at the bottom right of your browser turns red). Clicking on this status bar flag icon gives you a menu where you can view and modify which requests are blocked and allowed. You can whitelist requests you approve of by origin site, destination site, or specific origin-to-destination.\n\nMore information on the privacy reasons for using RequestPolicy is available at:\nhttps://www.requestpolicy.com/privacy\n\nMore information on the security reasons for using RequestPolicy is available at:\nhttps://www.requestpolicy.com/security\n\nRequestPolicy is not a replacement for NoScript! Each focuses on different, important issues. For the best security, we recommend using both RequestPolicy and NoScript. More information on the difference between the two is available here:\nhttps://www.requestpolicy.com/faq#faq-noscript\n\n*********************************************************************************\nNOTE: As with any extension that blocks content, some websites will not work properly until you have allowed the required content. If a website you visit isn't working, you can use the RequestPolicy menu to allow the cross-site requests the website needs. After a short while of using RequestPolicy, you will have whitelisted all of the required cross-site requests for sites you frequently visit and you will use the RequestPolicy menu much less.\n*********************************************************************************","developerComments":"    Please report bugs to us and send us your feature requests, comments, and questions.\n    ------------------------------------------------------\n    Email: support [-at-] requestpolicy [-dot-] com\n    Forum: http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=1051805\n    Bug tracker: https://github.com/RequestPolicy/requestpolicy/issues\n    Twitter: https://twitter.com/RequestPolicy\n    Help translate: https://www.requestpolicy.com/translate\n    Google+: +RequestPolicy","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/27/27523.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"343","height":"251","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/27/27523.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"146","caption":"You can see which requests have been allowed and chose to revoke permissions that you granted earlier."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/27/27522.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"700","height":"208","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/27/27522.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"59","caption":"You can allow requests from a specific origin site to a specific destination site.

In each tiled layout, tiles can be arranged horizontally, vertically or in a grid, and tiles can be re-sized by dragging splitter bars. Tabs and links can be dragged to open in new or existing tiles. The scrolling of tiles can be synchronized. A tiled layout can display tabs from more than one Firefox tab group.\n\nThe Firefox tabbed browser paradigm is fully maintained. Tiled layouts are achieved by presentational changes rather than functional changes. All features (menu commands, url bar, search bar, tabs buttons) continue to operate as normal.\n\nLayouts can be created and tabs can be tiled individually above, below, left or right of the active tile. Tiles are arranged in groups - where all the tiles in a group have the same width or same height - and all the tiles in a group are separated by splitters all with the same orientation (horizontal or vertical). Tiles can be displayed with a tab button for each tile - or with a single tab button for each layout.\n\nIndividual layouts can be saved, opened, deleted or set as the default layout. In addition, all of the currently open layouts can be saved as a single Multi-Layout.\n\nTiling is performed using Menu Commands, Keyboard Shortcuts or Drag-and-Drop of tabs and links.\n\nThe major features of the Tile Tabs user interface are illustrated in the above screenshots.\n\nUsers migrating from Tile View, please refer to the Notes for Tile View Users section below.\n\nGETTING STARTED\n\nTo get started, create a default layout by clicking on the Tile Tabs button icon or by pressing F12.\n\nSwitch between the tiled view and the normal browser view by clicking on the Tile Tabs button icon again or by pressing F9.\n\nAlternatively, try tiling two specific tabs using menu commands:\n\n    â¢ Select the first tab to be tiled by clicking on its tab button.\n    â¢ Click Tile on the main menu bar, or click the down-arrow on the Tile Tabs button.\n    â¢ Select Tile Tab on the sub-menu.\n    â¢ Select the direction - Above, Left, Right or Below.\n    â¢ Select the second tab to be tiled.\n\nClose the layout by double-clicking on the Tile Tabs button icon or by pressing F12.\n\nTHINGS TO TRY\n\nDrag-and-Drop tiling of tabs - to make tiling quicker - just Shift+Drag a tab or link:\n\n    â¢ For further details see the Drag-to-Tile Shortcut section below.\n\nAutomatic assignment of tabs - for a different browsing experience - enable these options:\n\n    â¢ Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected\n    â¢ Assign another tab when tiled tab closed\n\nUSER REFERENCE\n\nTiles and Splitters\n\nA tile can be made the active tile by clicking on the corresponding tab button or by clicking on the tile's contents. A tiled tab is indicated by a colored border around the tab button icon. The active tile is indicated by a colored border around the tile contents. The highlighting of tiled tabs can be changed to use colored text and/or italic text on the tab buttons. A different tab can be displayed in the active tile by doing Shift+Click on the tab button.\n\nA tile can be re-sized by dragging the adjacent splitter bars. Splitter bars will snap into position when near to the edge of a tile or another splitter bar. Splitter bars will also snap in line with other splitter bars anywhere in the tiled layout.\n\nDouble-click on any splitter to equalize the size of all the tiles in that group. Ctrl+Double-click on any splitter to equalize the two tiles on each side of the splitter. Shift+Double-click on any splitter to expand the smaller of the two tiles on each side of the splitter.\n\nTab Selection\n\nA tab is selected by clicking on the tab button in the tabs bar. By default, when in tiled view, selecting a tiled tab displays the tiled layout, and selecting an untiled tab displays the tab normally. Alternatively, there is an option (Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected) to always display the tiled layout when in tiled view. This option automatically assigns the selected tab to the active tile, if the selected tab was previously untiled.\n\nThe way that tab selection works can be temporarily changed using the Assign Tab mouse shortcut (see below).\n\nThe tooltips for tiled tab buttons show both the layout name and the web page URL.\n\nLayout Commands\n\nThere are four layout commands which appear on the main menus:\n\n    â¢ New Layout - creates a pre-defined layout with two, three, four or all tabs or using the default layout.\n    â¢ Recent Layout - quickly opens a recently used layout and assigns saved tabs (if any) to tiles.\n    â¢ Close Layout - closes the the active layout and all assigned tabs revert to normal operation.\n    â¢ Close All Layouts - closes all layouts all assigned tabs revert to normal operation.\n\nand seven more layout commands which appear on the Manage Layouts submenu:\n\n    â¢ Open Layout - opens a previously saved layout and assigns saved tabs (if any) to tiles.\n    â¢ Save Layout - saves the active layout and optionally the assigned tabs, pinned states, scroll/tab locks and layout color.\n    â¢ Delete Layouts - deletes previously saved layouts (multiple layouts can be selected).\n    â¢ Configure Layout - configures the name and color of the active layout.\n    â¢ Set Default Layout - sets the default layout to be used by the toolbar button and on start-up.\n    â¢ Import Layouts - imports previously exported layouts from a text file.\n    â¢ Export Layouts - exports previously saved layouts to a text file (multiple layouts can be selected).\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the Tile menu on the main menu bar, or from the Tile Tabs button menu on the toolbar.\n\nThe New Layout command always assigns the currently selected tab to top-left tile in the layout, and automatically creates and assigns new blank tabs to the other new tiles. The All Tabs submenu items create a layout containing all of the previously untiled tabs. There are options to assign existing tabs to new tiles in preference to creating new tabs, and to load the homepage into new tabs.\n\nThe Open Layout and Recent Layout commands reinstate tiled tab pinned states and scroll/tab locks (if any). The Open Layout and Recent Layout commands can also be used to open a Multi-Layout, which opens all of the individual layouts saved in the Multi-Layout.\n\nThe Close Layout and Close All Layouts commands automatically close any blank tabs created by New Layout that have not been used (still either blank or showing the homepage). There is an option to also automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n\nThe Save Layout command requires a layout name which cannot be null and can only contain letters, digits, underscores, hyphens and spaces. There are checkboxes to save tabs, save pinned states, save scroll/tab locks and to save the layout color. There are also checkboxes to save all of the currently open layouts as a single Multi-Layout and to save the individual layouts in the order of their first tabs on the tab bar.\n\nThe Set Default Layout command sets the default layout as a layout with two tabs or all tabs, or as a previously saved layout. This allows the default layout to be set to any layout that can be created using the New Layout command or tiling commands.\n\nTiling Commands\n\nThere are eight tiling commands which appear on the main menu, on the toolbar button menu and on the context menu:\n\n    â¢ Tile Tab - adds an existing tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    â¢ Tile New Tab - opens a new tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    â¢ Tile Duplicate Tab - opens a duplicate tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    â¢ Tile Link in New Tab - opens a link in a new tab in a new tile above, left, right or below the active tile.\n    â¢ Assign Tab - replaces the tab displayed in the currently active tile with another (tiled or untiled) tab.\n    â¢ Untile Tab - removes a tile and the assigned tab reverts to normal operation.\n    â¢ Expand Tile - expands a tile and collapses all the other tiles in that group.\n    â¢ Show Properties - shows a popup with the tab title and tab group for the active tile (see Properties Popups section).\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the Tile menu on the main menu bar, or from the Tile Tabs button menu on the toolbar, or from the context menus after right-clicking on a tab or a tile's contents.\n\nThe Assign Tab command assigns a different tab to be displayed in the active tile. If the chosen tab is already tiled in another tile (possibly in another layout), then the existing tab in the active tile and the chosen tab are interchanged.\n\nThe Untile Tab command automatically closes the assigned tab if it was a blank tab created by New Layout and has not been used (still either blank or showing the homepage). There is an option to also automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n\nThe Expand Tile command can be used repeatedly on the same tile to alternately expand the tile horizontally and vertically - and when the tile is already fully expanded to reinstate the original layout and tile dimensions.\n\nFor convenience, a Close Tab command can also be added to the content context menu.\n\nMode Switches\n\nThere are two mode switches which appear on the main menu:\n\n    â¢ View Tiled - toggles between the tiled layout view and the normal browser view.\n    â¢ Sync Scroll - toggles synchronized scrolling of tiles on or off.\n\nThese switches can be can be toggled from the Tile menu on the main menu bar or appmenu, or from the Tile Tabs button menu on the toolbar.\n\nSync Scroll (when ticked) synchronizes horizontal and vertical scrolling within each group of tiles. It allows easy comparison of two or more similar web pages. Any initial scrolling offset between the contents of the tiles in a group is maintained. There is an option to synchronize scrolling only when the mouse is over the active tile.\n\nView Tiled (when not ticked) shows the normal browser view with every tab displayed at at full size. It allows normal browsing in any of the tabs without closing the tiled layouts.\n\nOptions Command\n\nThe Options command appears on the main menus and gives access to the Tile Tabs Options dialog where all options settings can be configured (see Options section below).\n\nSplitter Commands\n\nThere are five splitter commands, three of which allow tiling adjacent to an existing group of tiles:\n\n    â¢ Tile Tab - adds an existing tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    â¢ Tile New Tab - opens a new tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    â¢ Tile Duplicate Tab - opens a duplicate tab as a new tile above, left, right or below the highlighted group of tiles.\n    â¢ Equalize Group - equalizes the size of all the tiles in the highlighted group.\n    â¢ Equalize All - equalizes the size of all the tiles in all of the groups.\n\nThese commands can be invoked from the context menu after right-clicking on a horizontal or vertical splitter bar.\n\nThe highlighted group of tiles is indicated by a dashed colored border around each of the tiles in the group.\n\nToolbar Button\n\nThe Tile Tabs button can be added to the toolbar by right-clicking the toolbar, selecting Customize..., and dragging the button onto the toolbar. The Tile Tabs button is automatically added to the toolbar on initial installation.\n\nThe Tile Tabs button can invoke immediate actions (by clicking on the icon) or display a drop-down menu (by clicking on the down arrow).\n\nClicking on the Tile Tabs button creates a default layout if there is no existing layout, and thereafter switches between the tiled view and the normal browser view.\n\nMiddle-clicking on the Tile Tabs button either creates a new default layout or closes the active layout.\n\nDouble-clicking on the Tile Tabs button closes all layouts.\n\nThere are options to re-configure all of the Tile Tabs button actions.\n\nProperties Popups\n\nA properties popup can be shown for the active tile using the Show Properties command. A properties popup displays the tab title and tab group name for the tab assigned to the underlying tile. Clicking on the main body of a properties popup will make the underlying tile active. Shift+Clicking on the main body of a properties popup will assign the tab in the underlying tile to the active tile.\n\n\nA properties popup also displays three buttons:\n\n    â¢ Assign Tab - assigns a different tab to the underlying tile.\n    â¢ Scroll Lock - prevents the contents of a tile being scrolled.\n    â¢ Tab Lock - prevents the tab assigned to a tile being changed.\n\nWhen a scroll lock or tab lock is infringed, a properties popup appears with the relevant lock button highlighted in red.\n\nThere are options to automatically show properties popups when the mouse enters the active and inactive tiles, and to automatically fade out the display of properties popups after a few seconds. There is also an option to change the width of the properties popups.\n\nWorking With Tab Groups\n\nTile Tabs is fully integrated with Firefox's tab group (Panorama) functionality. Tiled layouts can contain tabs from more than one tab group, but may be restricted to tabs from the current tab group. However, this restriction will be ignored when tabs are moved between tab groups in the Panorama window.\n\nThe tab lists in the Tile Tab and Assign Tab commands show all tabs in all tab groups. The tabs in the current tab group are shown at the top of the list above the first menu separator. The tabs in other tab groups are shown further down the tab list, with each tab group delimited by a menu separator. There is an option for tab lists to only show the tabs in the current tab group.\n\nA tab in a tiled layout that is not in the current tab group will be indicated by a dotted colored border around the tile contents.\n\nAutomatically Activating Tiles\n\nThere is an option to allow tiles to be automatically activated when the mouse enters (moves over) a tile.\n\nIt is still possible to move the mouse over other tiles without changing the active tile by holding down a configurable modifier key (Shift, Ctrl or Alt). This is useful when accessing the Tile menu on the main menu bar, or when accessing the Tile Tabs button on the toolbar, or when the Sync Scroll with wheel only when mouse over active tile option is enabled.\n\nRenaming Tabs With Layout Name\n\nThere is an option to rename all of the tiled tabs in a layout with the layout name, and another option to rename the browser window with the layout name if a tiled tab selected. The layout name can be changed using the Configure Layout command.\n\nShrink-to-Fit Zoom\n\nA Shrink-to-Fit zoom feature is provided both for individual tiled tabs and for all tiled tabs in a layout.\n\nThere are four control key shortcuts:\n\n    â¢ Ctrl + < - shrinks the web page in the selected tiled tab to fit the tile width\n    â¢ Ctrl + < twice - shrinks the web pages in all tiled tabs in the active layout to fit the tile widths\n\n    â¢ Ctrl + > - resets the zoom level for the selected tiled tab to the default zoom level\n    â¢ Ctrl + > twice - resets the zoom level for all tiled tabs in the active layout to the default zoom level\n\nFunction Key Shortcuts\n\nThere are six function key shortcuts:\n\n    â¢ New/Close Layout - F12\n    â¢ Untile Tab - F4\n    â¢ Expand Tile - F2\n    â¢ Show Properties - F1\n    â¢ Sync Scroll - F8\n    â¢ View Tiled - F9\n\nEach function key shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus a function key (F1-F12) - or can be disabled.\n\nArrow Key Shortcuts\n\nThere are three arrow key shortcuts:\n\n    â¢ Tile New Tab - Shift+ArrowKey\n    â¢ Tile Duplicate Tab - Ctrl+ArrowKey\n    â¢ Activate Tile - Ctrl+Shift+ArrowKey\n\nEach arrow key shortcut can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus an arrow key - or can be disabled. These shortcuts work even if there is no existing layout. There are options to disable these arrow key shortcuts when the keyboard focus is in a text box or when an untiled tab is selected.\n\nMouse Shortcuts\n\nThere are six mouse shortcuts (the default mouse action is shown):\n\n    â¢ New/Close Layout - Double-click tab\n    â¢ Tile Tab/Link - Shift+Drag tab/link\n    â¢ Copy Tab - Ctrl+Drag tab\n    â¢ Assign Tab - Shift+Click tab\n    â¢ Open In Next Tile - Ctrl+Middle-click link\n    â¢ Open In Prev Tile - Ctrl+Shift+Middle-click link\n\nEach mouse shortcut (except Copy Link) can be set as a combination of Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys plus a fixed mouse action (e.g. Click tab) - or can be disabled.\n\nNew/Close Layout\n\nDouble-click on a tab to create a new layout (if the tab is untiled) or close an existing layout (if the tab is tiled).\n\nTile Tab/Link\n\nShift+Drag a tab or link onto an existing tile's contents to open the tab's or link's URL in a new tile above, left, right or below the existing tile. A label beside the cursor indicates the direction in which the tab or link will be tiled when it is dropped. The direction is determined by the position of the cursor within the existing tile (e.g. if the cursor is near the top, then the new tile will be created above). To create the first two tiles of a layout, Shift+Drag a tab or link onto the currently selected (untiled) tab's contents. A new tab is created except when an untiled tab is dragged. The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nCopy Tab\n\nCtrl+Drag a tab onto an existing tile's contents to open the tab's URL in the tile. A new tab is not created. The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nAssign Tab\n\nShift+Click on a tab to assign the tab to the active tile. If the Assign tab to active tile when tiled tab selected or Assign tab to active tile when untiled tab selected options are enabled, then Shift+Click on a tiled/untiled tab will just select the tab (and not assign the tab to the active tile). The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nOpen In Next Tile\n\nCtrl+Middle-click on a link in a tiled tab to open the link in the \"next\" tile in the group (to the right or below). If the next tile contains sub-tiles, then the link will be opened in the topmost leftmost sub-tile. If the clicked link is in the last tile of the group, then the link will be opened in the first tab of the group. There is an option to open the link in a new tab rather than loading in the existing tab. The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nOpen In Prev Tile\n\nCtrl+Shift+Middle-click on a link in a tiled tab to open the link in the \"previous\" tile in the group (to the left or above). If the previous tile contains sub-tiles, then the link will be opened in the topmost leftmost sub-tile. If the clicked link is in the first tile of the group, then the link will be opened in the last tab of the group. There is an option to open the link in a new tab rather than loading in the existing tab. The modifier key(s) for the shortcut can be configured.\n\nStart-up and Restart\n\nTile Tabs can be configured to restore the layouts from a previous session when Firefox starts-up or restarts. After a restart, it should always be possible to restore the layouts. However, on start-up it is only possible to restore the layouts if the tabs from the previous session have been saved, which requires the Firefox option When Firefox starts: to be set to Show my windows and tabs from last time.\n\nTile Tabs can also be configured to apply the default layout when Firefox starts-up or restarts. The default layout is not applied if session restore is configured and possible.\n\nNotes For Tile View Users\n\nTo make Tile Tabs work in the same way as Tile View, three options must be enabled:\n\n    â¢ Assign to active tile when untiled tab selected\n    â¢ Assign to active tile when tiled tab selected\n    â¢ Assign another tab when tiled tab closed\n\nOptions\n\nThe Options Dialog can be accessed from the Firefox Add-ons Manager or by selecting Options ... on the Tile menu or on the Tile Tabs toolbar button menu.\n\nThe Options Dialog allows the user to:\n\n    â¢ Select a set of eight colors for multiple tiled layouts.\n    â¢ Change the width of the colored border around the active tile.\n    â¢ Automatically activate tile when mouse enters tile.\n    â¢ Change the key that stops automatic activation of tiles.\n    â¢ Syncronize Scroll with wheel only when the mouse is over the active tile.\n    â¢ Change the width of the properties popup.\n    â¢ Automatically show Properties popup when mouse enters the active and inactive tiles.\n    â¢ Automatically fade out the display of Properties popup after a few seconds.\n    â¢ Not to show the Tab Group name in Properties popups.\n    â¢ Change the size of the splitters.\n    â¢ Change the snap distance for splitters.\n    â¢ Change the highlighting of tiled tabs (show icon, color text or italic text).\n    â¢ Display a single tab for each layout (instead of a tab for each tile).\n    â¢ Move all tiled tabs to left-hand side of tab bar.\n    â¢ Rename tiled tabs with their layout name.\n    â¢ Rename browser window with layout name if tiled tab selected.\n    â¢ Assign untiled tab to active tile when selected.\n    â¢ Assign tiled tab to active tile when selected.\n    â¢ Assign another tab when tiled tab closed.\n    â¢ Assign existing tabs to tiles in preference to creating new tabs.\n    â¢ Assign existing tabs from right of selected/closed tab (instead of left).\n    â¢ Load new tabs with home page.\n    â¢ Keep selected tab when switching to tiled view.\n    â¢ Create new tabs to fill the last row/column of a new grid.\n    â¢ Automatically close tabs created by Open Layout.\n    â¢ Show the Tile menu on the main menu bar.\n    â¢ Only show tabs in the current tab group in tab lists.\n    â¢ Show the Tile submenu on the tab context menu.\n    â¢ Choose the menu items shown on the tab context menu.\n    â¢ Show the Tile submenu on the content context menu.\n    â¢ Choose the menu items shown on the content context menu.\n    â¢ Change the function key shortcuts (new/close layout, untile tab, expand tile, show properties, sync scroll, view tiled).\n    â¢ Disable the F12 Firefox shortcut for Firefox Developer Tools.\n    â¢ Change the arrow key shortcuts (tile new tab, tile duplicate tab, activate tile).\n    â¢ Disable the arrow key shortcuts if keyboard focus is in a text box.\n    â¢ Disable the arrow key shortcuts if untiled tab selected.\n    â¢ Change the mouse shortcuts (new/close layout, drag-to-tile, click-to-assign, open-in-next-tile, open-in-prev-tile).\n    â¢ Choose whether Open In Next Tile and Open In Prev Tile open link in a new tab.\n    â¢ Choose the commands to be performed for each of the Tile Tabs button actions (click, middle-click, double-click).\n    â¢ Restore the layout from a previous session on start-up and after restart.\n    â¢ Apply the default layout on start-up and after restart.\n\nThe Restore Defaults button restores all options to their original default setting.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/180/180014.png?src=api&modified=1478416667","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/180/180014.png?src=api&modified=1478416667","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"A tiled layout with six tiles."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/180/180015.png?src=api&modified=1478416667","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/180/180015.png?src=api&modified=1478416667","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Tiled tabs are indicated by blue borders around the tab button icons.

Trial version, fully functional.","fullDescription":"Illumination for Developers offers great features for lower level libraries like Ext Core and jQuery, but really shines for its support of abstract design patterns found in the likes of ExtJS, SproutCore, qooXdoo, Dojo Toolkit, EmberJS, and Backbone.\n\nThis trial version gets unlocked when purchasing from the home page, accessible from a buy button found inside the extensions Firebug panel.\n\nObject Naming\n\nIlluminations presents the framework objects in a smarter way. It recognizes what they are and shows the whole name, like \"Ext.DataView\" instead of \"Object\" in the console and the other Firebug panels. And instead of random properties being appended, it looks for a ID-ish and a Value-ish property to show. This gives you an idea what you are looking at when you are debugging. See the example without and with Illumination in the screenshots above.\n\nElement Highlighting\n\nNow, when you hover the mouse over the Ext.DataView above, it will highlight the component on the page. In the case above, the coder didn't give a descriptive itemId or name, so hovering over it does the trick -- it shows you exactly what that object is all about. This works for Ext Components and for Ext Elements. It even works for Ext Composite Elements -- it highlights all of its nodes on the page!\n\nContextual Menu\n\nWhen you right click on an element in Firefox, Firebug adds an \"Inspect Element\" menu item to open Firebug and bring you to that element in the HTML panel. Illumination does the same sort of thing, but tries to find the best match: ideally some sort of UI widget, else an Ext Element.\n\nIllumination Panel\n\nThere is a new panel added to Firebug called Illuminations, and when you use the contextual menu above, this is where it brings you. The Illumination panel is the place to inspect ExtJS objects: Widgets (usually derived from Ext.Component, but not always), Data (Ext stores, records, fields), and Elements (Ext.Element and its brethren). These views show the hierarchical structure of your code:\n\nIt really takes some playing around with all of the above to get a feel of how useful and fun debugging can be again.Try this example page and look at the DataView, and generally browse around. You can click on a data store and look at the records in the Records side panel!\n\nOther side panels include Properties (sorted by the object that defined the property) and Methods. See what Events are connected. There is even a Docs side panel that will bring up documentation for the widget you are looking at! And the full array of DOM related side panels showing you where in the DOM the component is at, that DOM element's CSS, etc.\n\nAnd whatever you click on can be found in the $0 variable in the console -- which is awesome if all the references to that object are hidden in JavaScript closures!","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/50/50494.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"661","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/50/50494.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"188","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Right click on an element in the page and quickly find out what component it belongs to!"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/50/50493.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"700","height":"496","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/50/50493.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"141","caption":"Showing easy access to Store information from a ajax request."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/52/52461.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"700","height":"471","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/52/52461.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"134","caption":"See documentation for the currently selected component."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/52/52500.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"700","height":"292","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/52/52500.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"83","caption":"Method side panel, while looking at Google Closure Library (experimental).

Knowing where you're connected to adds an extra layer of awareness to your browsing and can be useful to indicate the native languages and legal jurisdictions that may apply. Additional information can be obtained via a multitude of external lookups and users can add their own custom actions. All actions can be added to the flag icon's context menu and set to icon click or keyboard shortcuts for quick access.\n\nClicking the flag icon loads our default action, Geotool, which gives a detailed map showing the city the server is in and other useful information such as its local time and ISP. Many other actions are available for a wide range of uses such as:\n\n  â¢ Site safety and malware checks\n  â¢ Finding similar sites and reviews\n  â¢ Automatic translation to your language\n  â¢ SEO and web development research\n  â¢ Diagnostics like pings and traceroutes\n  â¢ Whois and DNS information\n  â¢ Page code validation\n  â¢ Quick URL shortening\n  â¢ Copying a server's IP address or other info\n  â¢ or you can create your own custom actions!\n\nFlagfox is simple, unobtrusive, and uses relatively little resources. In order to protect your privacy, country lookups are done locally rather than asking an external server about every page you browse to. It works by accessing an internal IP address location database, basically a rough map of the physical layout of the Internet, based on data provided by Maxmind. This gives a flag for the nationality of the actual location of the server you're connected to, rather than just the nationality of the domain name which may be different. Flagfox updates are provided on a monthly basis to keep this internal database accurate.","developerComments":"Supported locales: English, FranÃ§ais, Italiano, EspaÃ±ol, EspaÃ±ol (Argentina), CatalÃ , PortuguÃªs, PortuguÃªs (Brasil), Deutsch, Nederlands, Dansk, ÄeÅ¡tina, polski, lietuviÅ³ kalba, LatvieÅ¡u, Magyar, SlovenÅ¡Äina, Hrvatski, romÃ¢nÄ, Ãslenska, Svenska, suomi, Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ°, Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹, ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸, Ð¡ÑÐ¿ÑÐºÐ¸, ÎÎ»Î»Î·Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¬, TÃ¼rkÃ§e, ÕÕ¡ÕµÕ¥ÖÕ¥Õ¶, ×¢××¨××ª\n, Ø§ÙØ¹Ø±Ø¨ÙØ©, TiÃªÌng ViÃªÌ£t, Bahasa Melayu, ä¸­æ (ç®ä½), æ­£é«ä¸­æ (ç¹é«), íêµ­ì´, æ¥æ¬èª\n\nHere's a short FAQ with questions that are asked frequently. Read the full Flagfox FAQ for more.\n\nCan Flagfox be useful for security?\nFlagfox can be used as a warning as to when a server isn't where it should be. If you end up at a site claiming to be an American bank, and it shows as Nigerian, then you may want to think twice. However, while this can be useful, Flagfox should not be relied on for this as a scam site can be in America just as easily as anywhere else.\n\nIs Flagfox sending information about where I'm browsing to some server?\nNot during normal browsing, no. Flagfox uses an internal database of IP address locations and does not send anything anywhere during normal browsing. If you use one of the lookup features, such as Geotool or whois, then that server will be sent the necessary info (IP address or domain name) that one time to do the lookup. There are some other extensions that have some features similar to Flagfox and they do, however, send all of your browsing habits to their server to provide their information. Flagfox respects users' privacy and makes a point to not do that. (see the Flagfox privacy policy)\n\nIt's showing the wrong flag!\nMaybe, but probably not. Sites can be hosted anywhere, they can have domains of any nationality, and can have multiple cache servers sending out the same site from different locations. Flagfox looks up the actual location of the server you're connected to using its IP address and a database maintained by Maxmind, which may or may not be where you'd expect it to be. (read this for more info)\n\nOne of the actions does something I don't like.\nEach action is its own site; we certainly don't run them all, just Geotool. Use Adblock Plus to deal with any minor ads if you need to and if any action breaks or starts doing something evil please report it to us. Flagfox is quite configurable, so if you don't like the actions included feel free to use your own. You can get more and suggest your own on our forums.\n\nDoes Flagfox support IPv6 yet?\nYes! Flagfox has full IPv6 support and monthly updates contain both IPv4 and IPv6 database updates.\n\nDon't post bug reports, support requests, or feature suggestions in reviews! This is NOT a forum and Mozilla will eventually delete non-review reviews. Post any questions, problems, or suggestions on the Flagfox forum or comment on the blog or email me directly.","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/128/128264.png?src=api&modified=1394296408","width":"331","height":"342","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/128/128264.png?src=api&modified=1394296408","thumbnailWidth":"145","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Flagfox shows a flag icon in the location bar indicating the physical location of the current website's server.

If you want to add this one, you need to remove it from Bookmarks Toolbar via \"View -> Toolbars -> Customize\". Then go to Personal Menu Options, add an available item called \"Toolbar Box\", finally you may see the \"Bookmarks Toolbar Items\" in the available item list.\n\n*** Hint about Adding Toolbar Items ***\nIn \"Edit Menus\" panel, the available toolbar items depend on \"View â Toolbars â Customize...\" panel. For example, if \"New Tab\" button is available in Customize Toolbar panel, it will be available in \"Edit Menus\" also. It means you may only add the toolbar items that do not exist in any toolbar.\n\n*** Hiding the title text of Bookmark Items and History Items ***\nThe new available items -- Bookmark Items and History Items display with a title text named \"Bookmarks\" and \"History\". You may hide the titles with userChrome.css if you don't like it:\n\n    /*hide the title of bookmark items*/\n    #cm-bookmarks-box > :first-child,\n    #cm-bookmarks-box > menuseparator {\n    display: none;\n    }\n\n    /*hide the title of history items*/\n    #cm-history-box > :first-child,\n    #cm-history-box > menuseparator {\n    display: none;\n    }\n\n\n*** Add more columns in Firefox Menu with Personal Menu 5.0 ***\n!! THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTION IS FOR ADVANCED USERS ONLY !!\nSince the following steps are related to modifying JavaScript code. You should only continue if you are sure of what you are doing.\n\n    Install userChrome.js and restart Firefox.\n    Open the file \"userChrome.js\" in your profile, and paste the following code in to the file:\n\n        if (location == \"chrome://browser/content/browser.xul\") {\n        setTimeout(function() {\n        // this is the only setting you can edit\n        // each line equals to one column, wrapped with \"\" (double quotation marks)\n        // and split with , (comma)\n        var newLists = [\n        // DO NOT CHANGE THE LINES ABOVE\n        \"\",\n        \"\"\n        // DO NOT CHANGE THE LINES BELLOW\n        ];\n\n        var appmenu = document.getElementById(\"appmenu-popup\");\n        for(var i in newLists) {\n        appmenu.cm_containers[i+2] = appmenu.firstChild.appendChild(document.createElement(\"vbox\"));\n        appmenu.cm_containers[i+2].id = \"appmenu\" + (parseInt(i)+3) + \"ryPane\";\n        appmenu.cm_containers[i+2].cm_list = newLists[i].split(\",\");\n        appmenu.cm_containers[i+2].cm_topMenu = appmenu;\n        }\n        }, 10);\n        }\n\n    Open \"Personal Menu Options\".\n    Design your new column in the primary-pane in \"Edit Menu\" panel.\n    (Information: Firefox menu is divided in two columns: the left one primary-pane and the right one secondary-pane.)\n    Save the setting.\n    Go to about:config, copy the value of \"compact.menu.primaryList\" and SET IT TO EMPTY.\n    (Find \"compact.menu.secondaryList\" if you design the new column in secondary-pane.)\n    Open userChrome.js, paste the value into newLists. For example, if the value is aaa,bbb,ccc, the part of code in userChrome.js will be:\n\n        var newLists = [\n        \"aaa,bbb,ccc\",\n        \"\"\n        ];\n\n    Save userChrome.js.\n\nRepeat steps 3-8 to create your new columns. For example, the newLists bellow means creating 4 new columns:\n\n    var newLists = [\n    \"aaa,bbb,ccc\",\n    \"ddd,eee,fff\",\n    \"ggg,hhh,iii\",\n    \"jjj,kkk\"\n    ];\n\nMake sure the lines are split with comma, and there is no comma at the end of the last line.\nIf you are going to use userChrome.css to embellish the new columns, you may use the id of them in the selectors: \"appmenu3ryPane\", \"appmenu4ryPane\", etc.\n\nIn case of unexpected errors,\nDO NOT REUSE THE ITEMS THAT EXIST IN OTHER COLUMNS ALREADY!\n\n*** Why do some items become grey and disabled in Help, Tools, etc? ***\nFor example, if you add both \"Tools --> Options\" and \"Tools\" in Firefox Menu, when you open Firefox Menu, you will see the \"Options\" inside \"Tools\" is disabled. It is because Personal Menu is trying to keep the view of original menu, and create a dummy at the original position of the item. You may hide those dummy with userChrome.css:\n\n    [id^=\"cmRestorePoint-\"][disabled=\"true\"] {display: none}\n\n\n*** About Editing Right-click Menu ***\nIf you want to edit your content (right-click) menu, please try Menu Editor.\nPersonal Menu WILL NOT include this feature, since they are based on two totally different ideas.\n\n*** If There Is Not Your Language in Personal Menu ***\nIf there is not your language or it is incomplete, and you would like to be the volunteer for the translation, you are welcome to be the translator of Personal Menu! You may register in BabelZilla, then go to the page of Personal Menu, choose your language in \"Register me as translator for:\" at the bottom, and press \"Let's go\" to start your translation.\n\n\n*** Questions and Suggestions ***\nIf you have any suggestion, you are welcome to post them in \"What do you think?\" below.\nPlease notice that I can read Chinese and English only.\nSince I won't be notified when there is new review, I can't promise to reply you immediately.\nYou are welcome to discuss those problems or bugs with me by E-mail: mercichao AT gmail DOT com, or the forum

WARNING: IF YOU ENABLE ENCRYPTED SESSIONS AND RUN CCLEANER DO NOT ENABLE THE OPTION TO DELETE FIREFOX PASSWORDS. DOING SO WILL WIPE OUT THE KEY3.DB FILE IN YOUR FIREFOX PROFILE AND MAKE IT SO YOUR SESSION MANAGER SESSIONS CAN NOT BE DECRYPTED!\n\n2. Save button / menu item does not work and/or is grayed out - Likely your browser is set to \"Never remember history\" (i.e. permanent private browsing) history in the Privacy options. Due to Mozilla's policy that Add-ons MUST respect private browsing, Session Manager won't allow saving of private windows. This includes in backup sessions. Disable permanent private browsing and you will be able to save non-private windows again. If you don't like this, don't blame me, it's Mozilla's policy. See http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/02/23/private-browsing-support-required-for-add-ons/\n\n3. Recovering from a crash doesn't work - Crash recovery won't work at all if the user sets the option to never remember history or start up in permanent private browsing mode since no crash recovery data is saved by the browser. If you want to be able to recover from crashes don't set the browser to never remember browser history.","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/61/61138.png?src=api&modified=1341471852","width":"476","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/61/61138.png?src=api&modified=1341471852","thumbnailWidth":"136","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Session

The HttpRequester browser will utilize the nicely-formatted displays that those addons provide.\n\nSee Developer's Comments section below for full usage details.","developerComments":"Overview\n\n    View responses in an embedded browser, or in plain text (with an option to pretty-format XML/JSON).\n    A history of transactions is recorded (and kept across sessions). You can view past requests, and re-execute them. Selecting a transaction in the History list will show the full request/response.\n    For each transaction in the list, the request and response are shown, as well as the Elapsed Time and Content-Length (The value used is the Content-Length response header if available, and the size of the response body otherwise.)\n    Each column in the history list is resizable and re-orderable and can be hidden via the column picker. The ordering and width of each column are persisted.\n    Double-clicking a row in the history will show you a raw text version of the request and response\n    You can edit raw requests by double-clicking a row in the history list, or clicking the Edit Raw Request button. This is useful for easily viewing the request all at once, or for making quick tweaks to a previous request, such as adding or changing headers. This is\n    the same behavior as double-clicking a transaction in the transaction history list.\n    Recent URLs, header names, and content types are remembered across sessions, and can easily be selected from drop-down lists.\n\nUsage\n\n    HttpRequester can be opened via the Toolbar button (the green/red arrow icon), or opened via the Tools menu. Alternatively the shortcut CTRL-ALT-P will bring up HttpRequester.\n    You can press the Delete Request button to remove a selected transaction from history list. (You can also hit the Delete key)\n    You can copy a request/response to clipboard for pasting into bug report, etc. You can also copy existing requests from the clipboard by clicking the Paste Request button, and then executing the request. Select multiple requests at once by holding down CTRL while selecting another request from the list.\n    Press the <Esc> key to close the HttpRequester window\n    Save and load stored requests: To save a request, click on a request in the history list and click Save Request. You can optionally give the request a name.\n    To load a request, click on Load Request - that will bring up a list of all saved requests. You can select any request to load it into your history to view it, or you can click the Execute button to execute it immediately.\n\nAdvanced Preferences: (via about:config):\nIncreasing number of items in history\nextensions.httprequester.maxhistory - maximum number of requests to keep\nextensions.httprequester.url.maxhistory - maximum number of URLs to keep\nextensions.httprequester.contenttype.maxhistory - maximum number of content types to keep\nextensions.httprequester.header.maxhistory - maximum number of header names to keep\n\nYou can add custom methods to the list of available HTTP methods.\nTo add new Methods: enter \"about:config\" in your URL bar. Then filter on:\nextensions.httprequester.http.methods.custom.write\n\nDouble-click the value to modify it. You can change it to a list of comma-separated values like: [\"PROPFIND\", \"PATCH\"]\nYou can also add read-only custom methods too (these methods will not send any entity body) via extensions.httprequester.http.methods.custom.read<br>\n\nIf you have any questions/comments/suggestions, shoot me a note.","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/144/144966.png?src=api&modified=1413177370","width":"700","height":"470","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/144/144966.png?src=api&modified=1413177370","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"134","caption":"The HttpRequester window.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\n\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\n\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\n\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\n\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\n\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License. You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. Limitation of Liability.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\nCopyright (C)\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program. If not, see .\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\nCopyright (C)\nThis program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\nThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\nunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n.\n\nThe GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License. But first, please read\n.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/23/23517.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/23/23517.png?src=api&modified=1331218902"}],"homepageURL":"http://labs.securitycompass.com/exploit-me/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/access-me/?src=api","supportURL":"http://labs.securitycompass.com/exploit-me/","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":3,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/access-me/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":76745,"weeklyDownloads":23,"dailyUsers":44,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/88415/access_me-0.2.4-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":156672,"updateDate":1300202524000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"add-to-searchbox@maltekraus.de","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/3/3682-32.png?modified=1453263615","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/3/3682-64.png?modified=1453263615"},"type":"extension","name":"Add to Search Bar","version":"2.9","creator":{"name":"Dr. Evil","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/dr-evil/?src=api"},"description":"Make any pages' search functionality available in the Search Bar (or \"search box\")...","fullDescription":"Just make a right click (Ctrl+click on a Mac) with the mouse pointer on top of *the page's* search box and choose \"Add to Search Bar...\"\n\nIf you don't know how to use the extension, have a look at the second image - it's a screencast showing it in action.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/10/10738.png?src=api&modified=1383285047","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/10/10738.png?src=api&modified=1383285047"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/26/26482.png?src=api&modified=1383285047","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/26/26482.png?src=api&modified=1383285047","caption":"Screencast explaining the usage of this extension"}],"homepageURL":"http://firefox.maltekraus.de/extensions/add-to-search-bar","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/add-to-search-bar/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":5,"reviewCount":633,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/add-to-search-bar/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":2955826,"weeklyDownloads":956,"dailyUsers":51190,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/387922/add_to_search_bar-2.9-fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":26532,"updateDate":1453262531000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"{e4a8a97b-f2ed-450b-b12d-ee082ba24781}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/748-32.png?modified=1493212820","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/0/748-64.png?modified=1493212820"},"type":"extension","name":"Greasemonkey","version":"3.11","creator":{"name":"Anthony Lieuallen","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/arantius/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Aaron Boodman","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/aaron-boodman/?src=api"},{"name":"Johan SundstrÃ¶m","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/ecmanaut/?src=api"}],"description":"Customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.","fullDescription":"Allows you to customize the way a web page displays or behaves, by using small bits of JavaScript.\n\nYou can write your own scripts, too.

Then choose Customize and drag the Toggle Web Developer Toolbar button and drop it on wherever you want in the Navigation Toolbox. Do not forget to click on Done button of Customize Toolbar Panel.\n\nEven a smarter and faster toggle activity can be achieved by keyboard short-cuts. You can use CTRL + ALT + T keyboard combination to toggle Web Developer toolbar for Windows. COMMAND + Option + T is the keyboard combination for Mac users.\n\nWhile you can use other methods to accomplish the same task, it is easier to have the Toggle Web Developer Toolbar with a smaller icon on status bar within easy reach or with a keyboard short-cut that provides faster activation.

The Suite is easy to use, fast, efficient, reliable and always available.\n\nâ INTEGRATES WITH YOUR MOST COMMON TOOLS\nYou don't have to start another process if you wish to perform a web application security assessment. If you are a developer, our Suite will be as easily accessible to you as the built-in Chrome and Firefox Development tools. Everything is only just a click away.\n\nâ CLOUD-BASED BUT ONLY CLIENT-SIDE\nThe Websecurify Suite is a cloud-based web application security solution with emphasis on client-side technologies. This means that only application code, which includes the latest updates, is delivered from our servers. The rest of it, such as test data, test execution and other functions are kept on the client, i.e. your browser. This means that you can be absolutely certain that your data, sensitive or not, remains yours. You don't have to share anything with anyone, not even us. Finally, you can use it even when offline and test applications behind your firewall.\n\nâ SUPER SCALEABLE\nThe Suite can scale across organisations of any size and used by multiple computers and browsers. If you have a large development team, our Suite is the only solution, which can be used to provide automated web application security testing capabilities as part of your secure code development life-cycle (SDLC).\n\nâ MARKETPLACE FOR YOUR TOOLS\nYou don't have to pay for things you don't need. The Suite is customisable, which means that you can cherry-pick the tools, which provide most value to you and your team. The Suite Market is proudly the first in the world app store for web application security tools and utilities.\n\nâ ALWAYS UPDATED\nAll applications in the Suite run in standard browsers like as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. They are available in online and offline modes. This characteristic makes the Suite extremely scaleable. Software updates, installs and other nuisances are just problems of the past. This is perfect for large development, quality assurance and penetration testing teams.\n\nMore awesome features:\n\nâ¢ Easy to use\nâ¢ Always available\nâ¢ Runs inside your browser\nâ¢ Easily extensible with browser extensions\nâ¢ Exportable reports\nâ¢ Integration with 3rd-party tools\nâ¢ Automated and manual testing capabilities\nâ¢ Instantaneous updates\nâ¢ The full and complete testing engine\nâ¢ Fully configurable\nâ¢ Flexible, hassle-free\nâ¢ Can test OWASP TOP 10 and WASC\nâ¢ Observing HTTP request & responses\nâ¢ Resend HTTP requests\nâ¢ Cherry-pick the tools you need the most\nâ¢ Fun to use\n\nâ This is the first and only web application security solution designed to run entirely from your web browser. It packs our awesome web application security solution combined with the power of client-side technologies.\n\nâ The Suite is just a click away. You can type the url or click the application button. Either way, our platform will provide you with a complete web application security testing environment ready to perform at any time and from anywhere.\n\nâ Because all features are pulled from our servers, we can provide real-time support and improvements.

It can be used to interdict an ISP's DNS search redirection hijacks, preview/screen \"shortened\" URLs (e.g., TinyURL), stop the annoying redirection of \"smart\" error pages, etc.","fullDescription":"===== ===== ===== =====\nExamples of Usage\n===== ===== ===== =====\n\n\n* Stopping DNS error redirects\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nThe original impetus for NoRedirect came from my frustration over Verizon's search service, for which opting out was not always possible. Every time I hit a DNS errorâby mistyping an address, clicking on a link with a typo, leaving off a letter when copying and pasting, etc.âI would be redirected to Verizon's \"helpful\" search page, which meant that, if I wanted to fix my typo, I had to retype the entire address.\n\nSuch user-hostile services are now employed by virtually all major ISPs and even some domain registriesâmany users have experienced the frustration of being redirected after typing \".com\" as \".cm\". In addition to suppressing such redirects, NoRedirect will also restore the browser's native behavior: the browser will display its built-in DNS error message, and the browser's keyword search feature, if enabled, will be protected from interference caused by these DNS hijacks.\n\n\n* Previewing/screening \"shortened\" URLs\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nAmong the problems of URL shortening services is not being able to tell where a URL leads until it is too late. While some services offer \"previews\" if you set a cookie, not all services offer this feature. By blocking redirects originating from known URL shortening services, NoRedirect can be configured to act as a gatekeeper to make sure that all redirection service URLs are screened.\n\n\n* Stopping \"smart\" error pages\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nThere are some sites that, instead of displaying a standard error page, will redirect you to the site's main page or to a \"smart\" error page. More often than not, these measures, instead of being helpful, just end up disrupting the user's browsing experience, making it difficult to fix simple errors such as typos or the leaving off of a few characters when copying and pasting an address. NoRedirect can be configured to stop such nuisances.\n\n\n===== ===== ===== =====\nConfiguration\n===== ===== ===== =====\n\n\nNoRedirect operates using a customizable list of rules. You can block redirects based on their source (useful for screening redirection services) or destination (useful for stopping DNS error hijacks). The flexibility of the rule system makes it possible to exercise both coarse and fine-grained control. For example, you could treat the rule list as a simple blacklist, or you could treat the rule list as a simple whitelist by placing various allow rules above a wildcard block rule, or you could cook up you own scheme, such as creating a set of rules to block all redirects except for those that end in an image file extension or those that originate from example.org","developerComments":"Suggestions and bugs can be filed at http://code.kliu.org/tracker/\n\nAbout JavaScript redirects: While NoRedirect can stop both HTTP redirects and \"Refresh\" redirects, JavaScript redirects are simply too open-ended to be stopped without disabling JavaScript (e.g., using NoScript or YesScript).","eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/32/32198.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"432","height":"224","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/32/32198.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"103","caption":"NoRedirect in action: A normal blocked redirect (top) and a blocked DNS error redirect (bottom)"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/32/32199.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"656","height":"502","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/32/32199.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"196","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"NoRedirect's options dialog where the rule list is managed"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/32/32200.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"512","height":"128","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/32/32200.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"50","caption":"NoRedirect in action: A DNS error redirect blocked by NoRedirect"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/32/32201.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"512","height":"128","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/32/32201.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"50","caption":"NoRedirect in action: A blocked \"smart error\" redirect"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/32/32202.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"503","height":"253","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/32/32202.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"100","caption":"NoRedirect in action: Using NoRedirect to preview shortened URLs"}],"homepageURL":"http://code.kliu.org/noredirect/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/noredirect/?src=api","supportURL":"http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=1230675","averageRating":4,"reviewCount":54,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/noredirect/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":374173,"weeklyDownloads":2148,"dailyUsers":12745,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/115831/noredirect-1.3.2.13-fx+sm.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":22584,"updateDate":1301325543000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"{11483926-db67-4190-91b1-ef20fcec5f33}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/5/5673-32.png?modified=1440232967","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/5/5673-64.png?modified=1440232967"},"type":"extension","name":"FxIF","version":"0.4.9.1","creator":{"name":"Christian Eyrich","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/christian-eyrich/?src=api"},"developers":[{"name":"Ted Mielczarek","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/user/ted-mielczarek/?src=api"}],"description":"View EXIF data in image properties","fullDescription":"Whatâs it\nFxIF (Firefox exIF) allows you to view meta information data contained in JPEG images from the convenience of your Firefox (or SeaMonkey or other compatible) browser. Most digital cameras add EXIF data to all images you take and much editing software adds or allows you to add more informations on the picture and you the creator.\nFxIF is written entirely in JavaScript, and as such should be portable to all platforms that Mozilla runs on.\n\nUsage\nAfter installing FxIF, simply right click on an image, then click FxIF Data. The meta data will be displayed in its own window.\nNote: In the presence of the Element-properties extensionâwhich retrofitts the properties dialogue which was there up to Firefox 3.6âbeing installed, FxIF integrates itself there.\nThis also happens on Seamonkey which is why there wonât be added any menu entry.\n\nDoesnât work?\nIâd like my extension to work on your system as much as you do. Though sometimes it doesnât work for you and for changing this I definitely need your help.\nAdding your (negative) opinion as review is fine to me. But for trouble shooting Iâve e-mail too (see right column on the Add-ons page) where I can be contacted. What would be very helpful is whereâs the problem exactly (no context menu entry?, no properties dialogue?, no data?, error message?), what other Add-ons youâve installed, screenshot of the error, output from the Error Console and image you tried to get data from.\n\nIn detail\nWhat can it display?\nMeta data thatâs contained in JPEG image files in three forms:\n\n    binary EXIF data. This is added by most cameras automatically and contains technical informations on the camera model and manufacturer, date and time the image was taken, aperture and shutter speed used, focal length and much much more.\n    IPTC-NAA data in a binary structure (IIM). IPTC-NAA comprises a standardized set of fields focusing on informations as the name of the photographer, caption and title for the image, copyright informations, keywords a.s.o.\n    XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform). In contrast to aforementioned this data isnât stored binary but as an XML document within the image and isnât restricted to only camera or image informations but can hold both and even more. Itâs developed by Adobe and pushed by their applications including Photoshop. As said, XMP can hold various informations as all the EXIF data mentioned above and also those from IPTC-NAA as well as application specific.\n    Its advantage is the use of UTF-8 encodingâso data can be added in every language availableâand also the possibility to hold an information in more than one language simultaneously.\n\nOut of the camera most images will only contain binary EXIF data but this may change in future and thereâs much software for adding the other informations by you. And software like Photoshop will at least duplicate the EXIF information into XMP data and add data of its own to your image if you just save itâor at least if you donât do Save for Web.\n\nAnd which fields in detail?\nIn detail you can view the following EXIF fields: ImageDescription, Make, Model, Orientation, ModifyDate/DateTimeOriginal/DateTimeDigitized, Artist, Copyright, ExposureTime., FNumber, ExposureProgram, GPSInfo, ISO, ShutterSpeedValue, ExposureCompensation, MaxApertureValue, SubjectDistance, MeteringMode, LightSource, Flash, FocalLength, UserComment, ExifImageWidth, ExifImageLength, FocalPlaneXResolution, FocalPlaneResolutionUnit. ExposureMode, WhiteBalance, DigitalZoomRatio, FocalLengthIn35mmFormat, ColorSpace\nAlso following fields are taken from IPTC-NAA: By-line, Caption-Abstract, Headline, Instructions, CopyrightNotice, City, Sublocation, Province/State and Country\nAnd the following from XMP: dc:Creator, photoshop:Headline, dc:title, dc:description, dc:rights, xmpRights:UsageTerms, cc:license, photoshop:City, Iptc4xmpCore:Location, photoshop:State, photoshop:Country, tiff:Make, tiff:Model, aux:Lens, exif:DateTimeOriginal, exif:DateTimeDigitized, exif:FNumber, exif:ApertureValue, exif:FocalLength, exif:FocalLengthIn35mmFilm, exif:SubjectDistance, exif:ExposureTime, exif:Flash, tiff:Orientation, exif:ExposureBiasValue, exif:WhiteBalance, exif:LightSource, exif:MeteringMode, exif:ExposureProgram, exif:ExposureIndex, exif:ExposureMode, exif:ISOSpeedRatings, exif:DigitalZoomRatio, exif:GPSAltitude, exif:GPSAltitudeRef, exif:GPSLatitude, exif:GPSLongitude, exif:ColorSpace, photoshop:ICCProfile, photoshop:Instructions, xap:CreatorTool, softwareAgent in mm:History\nAdditionally the JFIF comment field is interpreted.\nThat said, not all data is displayed always and at once. First not all files contain all fields. And second if fields that exist to hold the same information like the photographers name or description of the image are present in more than one structure, the information is only displayed once. The priority in which theyâre used is XMP, IPTC-NAA, EXIF in descending order.\nAlso for your convenience if GPS coordinates are available in the EXIF fields, a weblink to a map provider is displayed behind them. At least it is in Firefox 3 and SeaMonkey 2 because earlier donât support the technique used. And be aware that these are the coordinates of the camera, not the object photographed which can differ significantly especially for tele photos.\n\nThatâs not that much, why not more?\nFxIF wants to give you the informations which most people most likely want to see when viewing an image in the browser. That is a quick look when, by which camera with which settings, where and some informations on the subject.\nThere are other applications that give you any possible information found in the image. But from our point of view their purpose is different and doesnât make much sense in the browser. Displaying all informations available in the file can simply be overwhelming and makes the basic informations hard to find.\n\nAnd why only in JPEG images?\nThat image format is by far the most common and concentrating on it keeps the extension simple.\n\nWhere is it supposed to run on?\nAs mentioned earlier itâs written in JavaScript and XUL, so it should run in combination with the GRE (Gecko Runtime Environment) everywhere GRE runs.\nOut of the box the extension is made for the Firefox browser from version 0.10 on, the Mozilla Application suite from version 1.7 on and its successor SeaMonkey from version 1.0 on.\n\nHow much does it cost?\nNothing. Itâs free software in terms of the Free Software Foundation. Itâs triple licensed as MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, LGPL 2.1 and like most extensions for the Mozilla platform comes with the source code in the XPI file itself.\n\nConfigure me\nSince likings are different we decided to make two functions configurable. You can do this via the options dialog on the Add-on Manager (available in Firefox and SeaMonkey 2) or by directly manipulating the respective pref.\nFirst option is to choose the format used for displaying coordinates. This is either Degrees Minutes (DM), Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) like 40Â° 43â² 20.7â³ N, 74Â° 02â² 47.2â³ W or decimal degree (DD) like 40.722417Â° N, 74.046444Â° W. Any informations are rounded to two decimal places in DM/DMS and six decimal places in DD format. The associated pref is extensions.fxif.gpsFormat where 0 means DMS, 2 DM, and 1 DD.\nThe other option is the map provider to use for the weblink. The default (when the pref isnât available or empty) is to use openstreetmap.org, but as I wrote, likings are different.\nSo to change it, insert any URL into the field (or pref). You can use really any URL, but to have the respective coordinates used, put a %lat% anywhere the latitude shall be inserted and %lon% anywhere the longitude shall be inserted.\nSo the default is\nhttp://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=%lat%&mlon=%lon%&layers=B000FTF\nbut if you want to use Google as a map provider, insert for example\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps?ll=%lat%,%lon%&q=%lat%,%lon%&z=10&hl=%lang%\nor for Yahoo use\nhttp://maps.yahoo.com/index.php#mvt=m&trf=0&lon=%lon%&lat=%lat%&mag=8\nor\nhttp://atlas.mapquest.com/maps/map.adp?searchtype=address&formtype=latlong&latlongtype=decimal&latitude=%lat%&longitude=%lon%\nfor MapQuest a.s.o. In URL langitude and longitude will always get inserted in unrounded decimal format.\nNoticed the %lang% in the Google Maps URL? This is the third placeholder available and will be replaced by the content language code youâve chosen in your general browser settings. Itâs not necessary but at least in case of Google offers the site in your language.\nYou can also add another parameter which is âz=â for Google or âzoom=â for OpenStreetMap and Yahoo! if you donât like the providers standard zoom setting. Simply write a zoom level after the equal sign (interesting levels should be around 15).\nThe associated pref is extensions.fxif.mapProvider.\n\nAre there localized versions?\nFxIF is already available in Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese (simplified as well as traditional), Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian and Spanish. The one used depends on the browsers locale.\nIf you donât find your language in the list, youâre welcome to do a translation and donate it. You can get the english version .dtd and .properties files from the FxIF repository and mail us the translated file for inclusion. Also fixes for errors in translations are welcome.\nFxIF also has a page on BabelZilla.org where translations are organized. You can add translations there as well.\n\nWhen will the next version be released?\nLike most projects âwhen itâs doneâ. Since 0.2.3 the FxIF code has its home at Google Code and the source kept online can be checked out via svn.","developerComments":null,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/16/16300.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","width":"373","height":"473","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/16/16300.png?src=api&modified=1331218902","thumbnailWidth":"118","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"View EXIF data in image properties."}],"homepageURL":"http://christian-eyrich.de/mozilla/fxif/","learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/fxif/?src=api","supportURL":null,"averageRating":4,"reviewCount":92,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/fxif/reviews/?src=api","totalDownloads":735705,"weeklyDownloads":274,"dailyUsers":24040,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/332308/fxif-0.4.9.1-sm+fx.xpi?src=api","repositoryStatus":4,"size":85013,"updateDate":1438120073000,"isPlatformCompatible":true},{"id":"foxyproxy@eric.h.jung","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2/2464-32.png?modified=1485624020","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2/2464-64.png?modified=1485624020"},"type":"extension","name":"FoxyProxy Standard","version":"4.6.5","creator":{"name":"Eric H.
